TASK 2 
Here i tried from 2 platforms to import testnet tokens but failed as they were claiming that to get a token i should have 0.01 ETH as a minimum balance
But by researching i got that i should copy the contract address from the block explorer website Etherscan and then paste it in my wallet.
And guess what i succeeded
